     - First name
     - Last name
     - Email
     - Text field
     - Cancel and Submit buttons

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - Add basic CSS to style the page and make it visually appealing.

3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
   - Create a JavaScript function that takes input from the user and displays a personalized greeting.
   - Implement event handling to call the JavaScript function when the button is clicked.
   - Use JavaScript to dynamically update the content of the web page.
